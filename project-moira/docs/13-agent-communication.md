# 13 — Agent Communication

## Purpose
Defines how agents hand off work, what format messages between agents take, and who talks to whom.

## Routing table
| From | To | When |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | Planner | New request/feature comes in |
| Planner | Architect | Task needs a design decision |
| Architect | Backend / Frontend | Design approved, ready to implement |
| Backend / Frontend | QA | Implementation complete |
| QA | Debug | Defect found |
| Debug | QA | Fix ready for verification |
| Any agent | Security | Change touches auth, data handling, or external input |
| Any agent | DevOps | Change affects build/deploy/infra |
| Orchestrator | Reporter | Checkpoint reached, status needed |

For Moira (solo + AI agent):
- The human owner is the Orchestrator, Planner, and final QA sign-off
- The Zed AI agent fills all active roles (Frontend, Architect, DevOps, Debug)
- Sub-agents may be spawned for parallel content work (card interpretations)
- The routing table above applies conceptually — the AI agent self-routes based on task type
- Backend and Security agents are not applicable to this project

## Handoff format
Each handoff should include:
- Task ID / reference
- What was done
- What's expected next
- Any doc updated as part of this task
- Open questions/blockers

## Conflict resolution
If two agents produce conflicting outputs (e.g. Backend and Frontend disagree on a contract), the Orchestrator routes to Architect for a binding decision, which gets recorded in `02-architecture.md`.
